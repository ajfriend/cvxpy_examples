# Ideas
- constrained RPS
- image deblurring
- elevator scheduling
- gerrymandering
- image segmentation as multiclass SVM, with features being the id of your neighbors
- road tax pricing to minimize congestion.

## image compression
- problem to come up with a sparse representation of an image which is
reconstructed accurately when using something like TV inpainting.
- induce sparsity with KKT complimentarity conditions
- induce sparsity so you are solving some problem, many of whose
constraints are not active. active constraints correspond to present pixels.
- form dual problem. dual variables correspond to constraints in primal problem. sparsify the dual to find constraints that are not active, can throw out in solving reconstruction problem.
- generalize to sparse signal coding.
